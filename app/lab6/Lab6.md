# Lab 6

Create a multipage, multitabbed app that uses the  different features such as :

- Biometrics -> [Expo Biometrics](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/local-authentication/)
- Camera -> [Expo Camera](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/camera/)
- Accelerometer -> [Expo Accelerometer](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/accelerometer/)
- GPS -> [Expo Location](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/location/)
- Battery -> [Expo Battery](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/battery/)
- Vibration -> [Expo Haptics](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/haptics/)

For each feature, create a simple UI that displays the data from the feature and a button to trigger the feature. 

For example for the biometrics, display a button that says "Scan Fingerprint" and when pressed it will ask the user to scan their fingerprint. 

If the fingerprint is valid, display a success message, if not display an error message.
